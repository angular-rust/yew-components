Material Design Components for the Yew framework.

**Angular Rust** is a high productivity, `platform-agnostic` frontend framework for the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It now supports desktop and web development. Angular Rust currently uses GTK for desktop development and WebAssembly for web development. We are planning to add support for mobile development.

Yew Material Components is a components library for [Yew framework](https://yew.rs/) which is a wrapper around [Material Design Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) exposing Yew components. All modern browsers are supported.


## Getting started

### Installation

Currently, this library is available from [crates.io](https://crates.io/). Add it using `cargo-edit`
```
cargo add ymc
```

Cargo features are used to pick the components. See [features](#features)   

`Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
ymc = { version = "0.1", features = ["full"] }
```
Material icons and a Material font can also be imported for full functionality.  
`index.html`:
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Material+Icons&display=block" rel="stylesheet">
```

It's also important to note that you need `viewport` `meta` tag for the Material Components to be responsive.
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

### Features

Following are all the cargo features available (each feature corresponds to its respective component):

- [x] `banner`
- [x] `button`
- [x] `card`

## Adding additional components
This is still a work in progress... feel free to add additional components.

To port a component that hasn't been ported yet open [TODO](https://github.com/angular-rust/yew-components/blob/main/TODO.md)

Implement a component you need and add it to the src/ directory.

## Theming

These components respect the theming applied to Material Design Components using stylesheets. [Learn about how to theme Material Design Components.](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/blob/master/docs/theming.md)
